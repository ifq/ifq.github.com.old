A distinguished young woman on a flight from Switzerland asked the  Priest  beside her, &quot;Father, may I ask a favor?&quot; &quot;Of course. What may I do for  you?&quot;  &quot;Well, I bought an expensive woman's electronic hair dryer for my  mother's  birthday that is unopened and well over the Customs limits, and I'm  afraid  they'll confiscate it. Is there any way you could carry it through  Customs for  me? Under your robes perhaps?&quot;<font size="2">
<p>&quot;I would love to help you, dear, but I must warn you: I will not lie.&quot;  &quot;With  your honest face, Father, no one will question you.&quot;</p>
<p>When they got to Customs, she let the priest go ahead of her. The  official  asked, &quot;Father, do you have anything to declare?&quot; &quot;From the top of my  head down  to my waist, I have nothing to declare.&quot;</p>
<p>The official thought this answer strange, so asked, &quot;And what do you  have to  declare from your waist to the floor?&quot; &quot;I have a marvelous instrument  designed  to be used on a woman, but which is, to date, unused.&quot;</p>
<p>Roaring with laughter, the official said, &quot;Go ahead,  Father</p>
