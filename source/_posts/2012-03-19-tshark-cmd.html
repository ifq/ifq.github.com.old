Usage: tshark [options] ...

Capture interface:
  -i &lt;interface&gt;           name or idx of interface (def: first non-loopback)
  -f &lt;capture filter&gt;      packet filter in libpcap filter syntax
  -s &lt;snaplen&gt;             packet snapshot length (def: 65535)
  -p                       don't capture in promiscuous mode
  -I                       capture in monitor mode, if available
  -B &lt;buffer size&gt;         size of kernel buffer (def: 1MB)
  -y &lt;link type&gt;           link layer type (def: first appropriate)
  -D                       print list of interfaces and exit
  -L                       print list of link-layer types of iface and exit

Capture stop conditions:
  -c &lt;packet count&gt;        stop after n packets (def: infinite)
  -a &lt;autostop cond.&gt; ...  duration:NUM - stop after NUM seconds
                           filesize:NUM - stop this file after NUM KB
                              files:NUM - stop after NUM files
Capture output:
  -b &lt;ringbuffer opt.&gt; ... duration:NUM - switch to next file after NUM secs
                           filesize:NUM - switch to next file after NUM KB
                              files:NUM - ringbuffer: replace after NUM files
Input file:
  -r &lt;infile&gt;              set the filename to read from (no pipes or stdin!)

Processing:
  -R &lt;read filter&gt;         packet filter in Wireshark display filter syntax
  -n                       disable all name resolutions (def: all enabled)
  -N &lt;name resolve flags&gt;  enable specific name resolution(s): "mntC"
  -d &lt;layer_type&gt;==&lt;selector&gt;,&lt;decode_as_protocol&gt; ...
                           "Decode As", see the man page for details
                           Example: tcp.port==8888,http
  -H &lt;hosts file&gt;          read a list of entries from a hosts file, which will
                           then be written to a capture file. (Implies -W n)
Output:
  -w &lt;outfile|-&gt;           write packets to a pcap-format file named "outfile"
                           (or to the standard output for "-")
  -C &lt;config profile&gt;      start with specified configuration profile
  -F &lt;output file type&gt;    set the output file type, default is libpcap
                           an empty "-F" option will list the file types
  -V                       add output of packet tree        (Packet Details)
  -O &lt;protocols&gt;           Only show packet details of these protocols, comma
                           separated
  -S                       display packets even when writing to a file
  -x                       add output of hex and ASCII dump (Packet Bytes)
  -T pdml|ps|psml|text|fields
                           format of text output (def: text)
  -e &lt;field&gt;               field to print if -Tfields selected (e.g. tcp.port);
                           this option can be repeated to print multiple fields
  -E&lt;fieldsoption&gt;=&lt;value&gt; set options for output when -Tfields selected:
     header=y|n            switch headers on and off
     separator=/t|/s|&lt;char&gt; select tab, space, printable character as separator
     occurrence=f|l|a      print first, last or all occurrences of each field
     aggregator=,|/s|&lt;char&gt; select comma, space, printable character as
                           aggregator
     quote=d|s|n           select double, single, no quotes for values
  -t ad|a|r|d|dd|e         output format of time stamps (def: r: rel. to first)
  -u s|hms                 output format of seconds (def: s: seconds)
  -l                       flush standard output after each packet
  -q                       be more quiet on stdout (e.g. when using statistics)
  -W n                     Save extra information in the file, if supported.
                           n = write network address resolution information
  -X &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;         eXtension options, see the man page for details
  -z &lt;statistics&gt;          various statistics, see the man page for details

Miscellaneous:
  -h                       display this help and exit
  -v                       display version info and exit
  -o &lt;name&gt;:&lt;value&gt; ...    override preference setting
  -K &lt;keytab&gt;              keytab file to use for kerberos decryption
  -G [report]              dump one of several available reports and exit
                           default report="fields"
                           use "-G ?" for more help

  Interaction

Since revision r1648, airodump-ng can receive and interpret key strokes while running. The following list describes the currently assigned keys and supposed actions.

[a]: Select active areas by cycling through these display options: AP+STA; AP+STA+ACK; AP only; STA only
[d]: Reset sorting to defaults (Power)
[i]: Invert sorting algorithm
[m]: Mark the selected AP or cycle through different colors if the selected AP is already marked
[r]: (De-)Activate realtime sorting - applies sorting algorithm everytime the display will be redrawn
[s]: Change column to sort by, which currently includes: First seen; BSSID; PWR level; Beacons; Data packets; Packet rate; Channel; Max. data rate; Encryption; Strongest Ciphersuite; Strongest Authentication; ESSID
[SPACE]: Pause display redrawing/ Resume redrawing
[TAB]: Enable/Disable scrolling through AP list
[UP]: Select the AP prior to the currently marked AP in the displayed list if available
[DOWN]: Select the AP after the currently marked AP if available
If an AP is selected or marked, all the connected stations will also be selected or marked with the same color as the corresponding Access Point.
