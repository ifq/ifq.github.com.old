git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD

git pull will do two things: it does a git fetch and then a git merge
where it merges branches that have been setup to be merged in your
config.

So what you want to do is to undo the merge (undoing the fetch doesn't
make a lot of sense and shouldn't be necessary).

To do that you can try using git reset --hard to reset to a previous
state. Use the git-reflog command to find the SHA-1 of the previous
state and then reset to it.


git clean -f
