<p>HONG KONG, June 27 - Talks to bring Apple's iPhone to mainland China have cleared their biggest hurdle and are now focusing on practical issues, the country's top mobile operator China Mobile said on Friday.</p>
<p>But there is no timetable for when China Mobile would bring the iPhone to mainland China, a spokeswoman said. &quot;Apple is no longer insisting on a revenue-sharing policy, so the biggest hurdle for China Mobile to bring in the iPhone has been cleared, but there are practical issues still to be resolved,&quot; said China Mobile spokeswoman Rainie Lei.</p>

Instead, they will subsidise the devices up front to make them cheaper.</div>
